# Radar-frame-registration

This repository achieves radar frame registration based on raw radar cell data based on SIFT feature extraction and RANSAC robust non-linear estimation.

A demo is contained in test.py to align two adjacent radar data frames in 2d. Several frames of data is provided in this repository. More details of the data set please visit the data repository provided by MISL, University of Birmingham.
